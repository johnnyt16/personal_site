# Personal Site

My portfolio site. Built it to have something to point people to that isn't just a LinkedIn page.

**Stack:** React + Vite, some fun animations from [React Bits](https://reactbits.dev/), and way too many CSS variables.

## Run it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it. It's jus a personal site, not a distributed system. 

## Why

For the people
